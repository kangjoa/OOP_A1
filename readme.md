# Project title: Bank Account

## Description
This python program simulates a bank account with a `BankAccount` class. The class has attributes for the account owner's full name, account type (either checking or savings), a unique 8-digit account number, and the account balance (which initially starts at $0). The `BankAccount` class contains methods to perform bank operations such as:
- Make a deposit
- Make a withdrawal
- Print a statement
- Add interest to the user's balance
